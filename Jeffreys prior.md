Named after the Bayesian statistician Harold Jeffreys. 

The Jeffreys prior is a prior over the parameter space $\Theta$ is [[Bayesian statistics]] that is proportional to the determinant of the [[Fisher information]] matrix: 
$$
\pi(\theta) \propto \sqrt{|I(\theta)|}.
$$
Jeffreys was motivated to find a prior which remained invariant under re-parameterizations of $\Theta$.
