Fixed-time bounds are results that hold only at some pre-specified sample size $n$. This is the case for the vast majority of [[concentration inequalities]] and is the norm [[hypothesis testing]]. 

The opposite of fixed-time results are [[time-uniform]] results or [[anytime-valid]] results (which sometimes coincide and sometimes do not).
