Many studies use [[p-value|p-values]] to analyze the significance of their claims. P-hacking refers to any method which is used by the researchers (wittingly or unwittingly) to fallaciously lower a p-value in order to make their conclusions seem more significant. This can involve removing "problematic" observations, gathering more data until significance is reached, or performing [[multiple testing]] without appropriately adjusting your p-values. 

Some of these issues are avoidable with different statistical tools (eg [[e-value|e-values]] enable optional stopping and continual monitoring)—see [[issues with p-values]]. But some can't be combatted regardless of the sophistication of your statistical tools (removing observations or restarting the study, for instance). If a practitioner is determined to achieve significance, then complicated math is not going to stop them.
