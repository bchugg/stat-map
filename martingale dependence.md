Assuming that your data is iid is becoming less and less cool (get with it!). If you don't want to make such a strong assumption, a natural question is what kind of dependency you want to introduce. Martingale dependency is usually the go to option after iid. After that, you get into the complicated world of Markov dependencies or time-series data.
