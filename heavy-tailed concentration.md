In [[light-tailed, unbounded scalar concentration|light-tailed settings]], mean estimation is synonymous with [[concentration inequalities|concentration]], since the sample-mean is the natural estimate of the mean and we're usually interested in concentration of the sum or mean of random variables. In heavy-tailed settings this is not the case, as the sample mean is a suboptimal estimate of the mean. 

So here we ask what we can say about the sample mean, and we discuss [[scalar heavy-tailed mean estimation]] and [[multivariate heavy-tailed mean estimation]] elsewhere.
