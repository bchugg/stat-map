Let $(\Omega, \cZ)$ be a gamble space in [[game-theoretic probability]]. Given an event $A\subset\Omega$, we define the upper probability of $A$ as 
$$\ov{P}(A) = \ov{\E}^g[\ind_A],$$
where $\ov{\E}^g$  is the upper expectation ([[game-theoretic expectations]]). Similarly, the lower probability is defined as 
$$\un{P}(A) = \un{\E}^g[\ind_A].$$
If $\ov{P}(A) = \un{P}(A)$ we simply write $P(A)$.
