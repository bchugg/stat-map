In [[hypothesis testing]], we are interested in quantifying evidence against the null so that we can decide when to reject it. Many statistical tools have been invented for this task, including [[p-value|p-values]], [[e-value|e-values]], and [[Bayes factors]].  

As a philosophical aside, note that the word "evidence" is well-defined in hypothesis testing since it is a small-world (see [[small worlds vs large worlds]] and [[evidence is quantifiable in small-worlds]].
