In [[hypothesis testing]], we are interested in quantifying evidence against the null so that we can decide when to reject it. Many statistical tools have been invented for this task, including [[p-value|p-values]], [[e-value|e-values]] (and [[e-process|e-processes]]) and [[Bayes factors]].  

There is a longstanding debate about whether evidence against the null can be measured without respect to any particular alternative. The [[likelihood principle]] and the [[law of likelihood]] say no: evidence only makes sense if an alternative is defined. Arguably, this is also the view of Neyman and Pearson (see the [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm]]), though this is because they were interested in decision making instead of quantifying evidence. 

As a philosophical aside, note that the word "evidence" is well-defined in hypothesis testing since [[statistical inference]] takes place in small-worlds (see [[small worlds vs large worlds]] and [[evidence is quantifiable in small-worlds]]).
