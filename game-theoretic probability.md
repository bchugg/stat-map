Game-theoretic probability (GTP) is a foundation for probability theory, distinct from the measure-theoretic foundations laid out by Kolmogorov in the 1920s. Whereas Kolmogorov conceptualized probability as a subset of measure theory, game-theoretic probability lays its foundations in game-theory.  

GTP makes statements by means of iterated games between various players, often consisting of reality, skeptic, and possibly several other players. The moves made by reality are the "observations," and skeptic is betting on the result of the moves. A GTP statement often has the following form: Either (i) the observations obey some property, or (ii) the skeptic can make infinite money.

Some key differences between GTP and measure-theoretic probability (MTP): 
- The definition of a probability measure comes first in MTP, and then expectations are defined as integrals with respects to measures. In GTP, the definition of expectations comes first, and then probabilities are defined afterwards. 
- GTP statements are usually made with no reference to distributions, randomness, measures, etc. They are therefore typically much easier to understand than MTP statements. 
- GTP is inherently sequential 

[[game-theoretic statistics]] is the application of game-theoretic probability to statistical procedures, such as hypothesis testing.
