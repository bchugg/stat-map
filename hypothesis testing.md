We have a null hypothesis $H_0$ and (usually, though see [[Fisher's paradigm]]) an alternative hypothesis $H_1$, both of which are collections (possibly singletons) of distributions on some measurable space $(\Omega, \calF)$. We obtain a sample $X\sim R \in H_0\cup H_1$ and want to determine if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null (that $R\in H_0$). 

There are many subtopics in hypothesis testing. Eg:  
- [[game-theoretic hypothesis testing]] 
- [[duality between hypothesis tests and CIs]]
- [[two-sample testing]]
- [[conditional independence testing]]
- [[multiple testing]]
