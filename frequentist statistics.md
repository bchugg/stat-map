Frequentist statistics include the methods that most people are first exposed to. If you don't know what you're doing, you're probably a frequentist (the converse is not true). 

More technically, frequentist statistics in [[statistical inference]] refers to the choice to model the unknown parameter as fixed and unknown (as opposed to random and unknown like in [[Bayesian statistics]]). Frequentist results do not include any user-specified priors. For instance, [[confidence intervals]] are considered frequentist, whereas [[credible intervals]] are considered Bayesian. When we evaluate frequentist methods, we look at what happens if we were to repeatedly run the experiment. 

Philosophically it is justified by the [[frequentist interpretation of probability]].
