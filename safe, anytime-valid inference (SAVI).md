A sub-field of statistics concerned with estimation and uncertainty quantification which are sequentially valid, i.e., remain valid at all stopping times. This enables procedures that are (i) immune to (many forms of) p-hacking,(ii) allow stopping rules to be data-dependent, and (iii) allow one to continuously monitor incoming data. 

Though valid measure-theoretically, SAVI results typically rely on [[game-theoretic statistics]] and [[game-theoretic probability]], both intuitively and mathematically. 

Common tools in SAVI include: 
- [[confidence sequences]]
- [[e-process]]es. 
- non-negative supermartingales and submartingales (indeed, in some sense, SAVI must rely on these: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03167), especially [[test-martingale]]s.
