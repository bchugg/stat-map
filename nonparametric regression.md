Here we're interested in estimating
$$

m(x) = \E[Y|X=x].

$$
in a nonparametric setting ([[parametric versus nonparametric statistics]]), i.e., under no assumptions on the underlying data generation process. This is equivalent to writing 
$$

Y = m(X) + \eps

$$
where $\eps$ has mean zero. 

Methods for nonparametric regression: 
- [[partitions and trees]]
- [[splines]]
- [[knn]]
- [[kernel regression]]

All of these are special cases of [[local polynomial regression]].
