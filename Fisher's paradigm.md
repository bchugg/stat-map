Fisher was focused on significance testing. He introduced the [[p-value]] as a measure of [[evidence against the null]]. His general procedure was 

- Choose a test-statistic $T$ 
- Compute the [[p-value]] under the null: $\Pr( T(X) \geq t)$ where $t$ is the observed value of the test-statistic 
- Reject $H_0$ if the p-value is small. 

Note that in Fisher's paradigm, there is no notion of a significance level $\alpha$ (unlike the [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm]]), and there is no alternative hypothesis.
