Overview of [[central limit theorems]] in [[Banach space|Banach spaces]]. 

In 1976 Hoffman-Jorgenson and Pisier show the the CLT holds in Banach spaces of type 2 for iid random variables $(X_i)$ if the variance is finite. See: [The Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem in Banach Spaces](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2243043).
