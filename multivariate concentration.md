A general pointer page to various multivariate concentration bounds. Multivariate refers to bounds on random vectors in $\Re^d$ but also more general spaces such as [[Hilbert space|Hilbert spaces]] and [[Banach space|Banach spaces]]. 

For specific bounds see 
- [[multivariate light-tailed concentration]]
- [[multivariate heavy-tailed concentration]]

For an overview of challenges and techniques, see [[techniques for multivariate concentration]].
