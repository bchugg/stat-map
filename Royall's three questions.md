In _Statistical Evidence: A likelihood paradigm_, Richard Royall distinguishes between three questions that a statistician might ask when he receives a new observation (or set of observations): 

1. What do I believe, now that I have this observation? 
2. What should I do, now that I have this observation? 
3. What does this observation tell me about hypothesis $A$ vs hypothesis $B$? 

He claims that confusing these three questions leads to confusion in the [[foundations of statistics]]. 
The [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm]] is concerned with question 2. Royall claims that 3 is best answered by the [[law of likelihood]].  

For my part, I think statistics isn't in the business of answering question 1. I don't believe that there are normative rules for thought which follow from any formal system. A [[Bayesian interpretation of probability|subjective Bayesian]], on the other hand, would argue that belief should obey the probability calculus.
