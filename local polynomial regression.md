[[kernel regression]], [[knn]] methods, and [[partitions and trees]] can be generated by  minimizing the following sum: 
$$\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(x)(c- Y_i)^2,$$
as a function of $x$.  This is a simple optimization problem which yields the solution 

$$c^*(x) = \frac{\sum_i w_i(x) Y_i}{\sum_i w_i(x)}.$$

Thus, we can see that KNN regression arises from taking $w_i(x) = \ind[x\in N_k(X_i)]$ ($N_k(x)$ are the k-nearest neighbours of $x$). More generally, partition-based regressors follow from taking $w_i(x) = \ind[R(x) = R(x_i)]$, where $R(x)$ is the region of the feature space to which $x$ belongs. Finally, kernel regression follows from taking $w_i(x) = K(||x - X_i||/h)$. 

We note that above equation is solved for at test time, i.e., for each new test point $x$. In that sense, they are "local": The (weight of) the set of samples recruited to take part in the optimization depends on the locality of the test point $x$. 

_Local polynomial regression_ generalizes the above by replacing $c$ with a polynomial. The objective becomes, for dimension $d=1$,  
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(x)\bigg(Y_i - \sum_{j=0}^r \beta_jx^j\bigg)^2.$$
Note we're minimizing over $\beta_0,\dots,\beta_r$, which will be functions of $x$.  If $r=1$ this is referred to as local _linear_ regression. By writing it out in matrix form, it's not hard to see that solution is  
$$\beta(x) = (A^T W A)^{-1} W^T Ay,$$
where $A$ is the matrix with $i$-th row equal to $a(x_i)$ and $W$ is the diagonal matrix whose $i$-th diagonal entry is $w_i(x)$. The predictor is then $\wh{m}(x) = (1,x,\dots,x^r)^T \beta(x)$. 
The solution is very reminiscent of [[weighted least squares]].
