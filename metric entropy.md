Given a metric space $(X,\rho)$, the metric entropy is $\log N(\delta; X,\rho)$ where $N(\delta; X,\rho)$ is the $\delta$-covering number of $(X,\rho)$; see [[covering and packing]]. 

Metric entropy is a measure of the complexity of the set $X$. Typically $N(\delta)$ diverges as $\delta\to0$, and we are interested in the _rate_ at which it goes to zero.
