In [[sequential hypothesis testing]] based on [[e-value|e-values]] (i.e., [[game-theoretic hypothesis testing]]), one wants to find e-values and [[e-process|e-processes]] which grow quickly under the alternative. "Quickly" is a non-technical condition, however. What exactly should be maximized? Various authors have used different conditions based on the particular problem at hand. 

## GRO 

"Growth rate optimality". Consider a simple alternative ([[testing by bettingâ€”simple vs simple]]). This says to find the e-value which maximizes $\E_Q [\log E_\tau]$ under the alternative $Q$. This is the same principle as [maximizing log-wealth]]. 

## REGROW 

Consider a composite alternative; a class of distributions $\calQ$.
