> [!note] Definition 
> A collection of zero-mean random variables $\{X_\theta:\theta\in\Theta\}$ is a sub-Gaussian process wrt to a metric $\rho$ if 
> $$\E[\exp(\lambda(X_\theta - X_\phi))] \leq \exp(\lambda^2\rho^2(\theta, \phi)/2),$$

The Rademacher process and the canonical Gaussian process (see [[Rademacher complexity]] and [[Gaussian complexity]]) are examples of sub-Gaussian processes. 

As in the case of tail bounds for sub-Gaussian random variables ([[light-tailed scalar concentration]]), using the [[Chernoff method]] we see that the above definition is equivalent to 
$$\Pr(|X_\theta - X_\phi| \geq \eps) \leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{t^2}{2 \rho^2(\theta, \phi)}\right).$$
