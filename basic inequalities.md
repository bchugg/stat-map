Some basic probabilistic inequalities. Used mostly under the hood to build more sophisticated [[concentration inequalities]], but also useful in other scenarios. 

## Markov's inequality 

For a nonnegative random variable $X$ and parameter $a>0$, Markov's inequality states that 
$$\Pr(X\geq a)\leq \E[X]/a.$$
The proof is easy: 
  $$\E X = \int_0^\infty x dP \geq \int_a^\infty xdP \geq a\int_a^\infty dP = a\Pr(X\geq a).$$
Markov's inequality is tight in the sense that there are distributions for which the inequality holds with equality. But it is not very interesting in the sense that it doesn't provide interesting concentration behavior. However, it's a cornerstone in more sophisticated concentration techniques, which often rely on applying Markov's inequality to the random variable 
$$\exp\left(\lambda \sum_{i\leq n} X_i\right).$$
(See the Chernoff method below, which is precisely this strategy.) 

Some notes and pointers: 
- There is also a game-theoretic version: [[game-theoretic concentration inequalities#Markov's inequality]]. 
- [[Ville's inequality]] is a time-uniform extension of Markov's inequality for nonnegative supermartingales (or reverse submartingales, as the case may be). Just as Markov's inequality is used as a foundation for concentration inequalities, Ville's inequality is used as a foundation for [[time-uniform]] concentration inequalities. 
- There is also a randomized Markov's inequality [[randomized inequalities#Markov]] which uses [[external randomization]].  
- An intuition explanation of Markov's inequality is the [[optimization perspective on Markov's inequality]]. 

## Chebyshev's inequality 

Chebyshev's inequality is simply Markov's inequality applied to $(X-\mu)^2$. For $a>0$, 
$$\Pr(|X-\mu| \geq a) = \Pr(|X-\mu|^2 \geq a^2) \leq \frac{\Var(X)}{a^2}.$$
Chebyshev's inequality gives the first flavor of concentration. If $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are iid with mean $\mu$, then Chebyshev gives 
$$\Pr(|\ov{X}_n - \mu|\geq a) \leq \frac{\Var(\ov{X_n})}{a^2} = \frac{\Var(X)}{na^2},$$
where $\ov{X}_n = n^{-1}\sum_i X_i$. Making the RHS equal to $\delta$ gives with probability $1-\delta$, $$|\ov{X}_n-\mu| \leq \sqrt{\Var(X) / (\delta n)}.$$
The _rate_ of concentration here is actually not too bad, it scales with $\sqrt{n}$ which is what we expect in many scenarios. However, the dependence on $1/\sqrt{\delta}$ is not great. We'd rather have $\log(1/\delta)$, which is an exponential improvement over $1/\sqrt{\delta}$. The Chernoff method gives us this sort of dependence, so we turn to that next. 

Note that the Chebyshev's inequality is a specific instance of the [[method of moments for concentration]]. 
## Chernoff method 

The Chernoff method applies Markov's inequality to the nonnegative random variable $e^{\lambda X}$, and then chooses $\lambda$ to optimize the bound. More detail is given in [[Chernoff method]].
