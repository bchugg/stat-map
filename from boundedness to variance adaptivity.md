This is simply the observation that in various [[concentration inequalities]] for bounded observations, we often begin with a result that takes advantage only of these known bounds. 

For scalar-valued concentration this is Hoeffding's bound ([[light-tailed scalar concentration]]), for martingale bounds this is the Azuma-Hoeffding bound ([[martingale concentration]]).
