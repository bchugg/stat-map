This is simply the observation that in various [[concentration inequalities]] for bounded observations, we often begin with a result that takes advantage only of these known bounds. 

For scalar-valued concentration this is Hoeffding's bound ([[light-tailed scalar concentration]]), for martingale bounds this is the Azuma-Hoeffding bound ([[martingale concentration]]). 

Such bounds can usually be strengthened to include the variance of the observations, which might be much smaller than the bounds. This gives Bernstein's bound in the scalar case ([[light-tailed scalar concentration#Bernstein bound]]), a variance-adaptive bound in the martingale case ([[martingale concentration#Variance bound]]) and a Bernstein-type bound in the matrix case ([[operator norm inequalities#Bernstein inequality]]).
