A sub-exponential distribution has tails which decay at an exponential rate. This is a weaker condition than [[sub-Gaussian distributions|sub-Gaussianity]] (meaning that sub-Gaussian tails decay at a faster rate, $\propto t^2$ instead of $\propto t$) but is still considered a light-tailed condition as the [[MGF]] exists in some neighborhood. 

Sub-exponential conditions are also natural conditions to study because a variable $X$ is sub-Gaussian iff $X^2$ is sub-exponential. So sub-exponential distributions arise naturally when studied the square (or squared norm) of sub-Gaussian variables and processes.
