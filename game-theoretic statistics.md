The application of [[game-theoretic probability]] to statistical tasks, often yielding superior procedures to traditional methods. For instance, see [[game-theoretic hypothesis testing]]. 

While the results can be stated in the language of [[game-theoretic probability]], they are often stated measure theoretically for practical purposes (and to convince other statisticians and practitioners of the value of the methodology). 

Game-theoretic statistics might be considered as third perspective on the [[foundations of statistics]], just like [[Bayesian statistics]] and [[frequentist statistics]].
