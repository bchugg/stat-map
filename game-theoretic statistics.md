The application of [[game-theoretic probability]] to statistical tasks, often yielding different—and sometimes superior—procedures to traditional methods. See, for instance, [[game-theoretic hypothesis testing]]. Modern approaches to [[safe, anytime-valid inference (SAVI)]] tend to use the toolbox of game-theoretic statistics. Much of the recent work on [[confidence sequences]], [[e-value|e-values]], and [[e-process|e-processes]] is motivated by, or based on, game-theoretic statistics. 

While game-theoretic statistics was originally formulated in terms of [[game-theoretic probability]], and the results can be stated in that language, they are often stated measure theoretically for practical purposes (and to convince other statisticians and practitioners of the value of the methodology). 

Game-theoretic statistics might be considered a third perspective on the [[foundations of statistics]], alongside [[Bayesian statistics]] and [[frequentist statistics]].
