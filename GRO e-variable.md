GRO stands for "growth rate optimality". The term was coined by [Grunwald, De Heide, and Koolen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07801) (2023). 

Consider a simple alternative. This says to find the e-value which maximizes $\E_Q [\log E_\tau]$ under the alternative $Q$. This is the same principle as [[maximizing log-wealth]]. 

When the null is simple, the GRO e-variable is given by the likelihood ratio (see [[testing by bettingâ€”simple vs simple]])  for the proof). For composite nulls $\calP$, the GRO e-variable is given by the pseudo likelihood ratio $q / p^*$ where $p^*$ is the [[reverse information projection (RIPr)]] of $Q$ onto the convex hull of $\calP$.
