This is a simply but useful observation that Chernoff bounds are often [[e-value|e-values]] in hiding. Indeed, Chernoff bounds often have the form of an [[exponential inequalities|exponential inequality]]: $\E\exp\{\lambda X - \log \E \exp X\}\leq 1$. This fact underlies the [[time-uniform]] extension of the [[Chernoff method]] in the form of [[sub-psi process|sub-psi processes]].
