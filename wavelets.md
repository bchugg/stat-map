Wavelets are a method for [[nonparametric regression]]. The resulting estimators $\wh{m}(x)$ of $m(x) = \E[Y|X=x]$ are one of the few examples of estimators that are not [[linear smoothers]]. 

Roughly speaking, they can be generated by solving quadratic optimization problems with $\ell_0$ or $\ell_1$ norm regularization (instead of higher norms which are differentiable and thus give nice closed form solutions which are linear).
