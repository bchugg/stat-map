# Gamble spaces, prices, and probabilities 

Like measure-theoretic probability, GTP introduces various notation and concepts to formalize the discussion. 

Let $\Omega$ be the _outcome_ space, i.e., the set of things that can happen. Elements $\omega\in\Omega$ are called _outcomes_ and subsets $A\subset \Omega$ are called _events_.   

A variable is a mapping $X:\Omega\to\overline{\Re}$,  where $\overline{\Re}$ is the extended reals. A useful way to think about variables is as contracts. Eg, $X$ might be the contract "if this coin lands heads then the bearer obtains 1 dollar". Here $\Omega=\{H,T\}$ and $X(H)=1$, $X(T)=0$. Then we can start asking questions such as: "How much are you willing to pay $X$ for?" 

A gamble is also a mapping $Z:\Omega\to\overline{\Re}$, but it's useful to differentiate gambles from variables. 
Think of the outcome $Z(\omega)$ is how much money is obtained when the outcome is $\omega$ when using gambling strategy $Z$. 

The set of all gambles under consideration is $\calZ$ and together $(\Omega,\calZ)$ form the _Gamble space_.  
Using the concept of a gamble space, we can define [[game-theoretic expectations]] which in turns defines [[game-theoretic probabilities]]. 

Just as there are concentration results for random variables in MTP, so too there are concentration results in GTP: [[game-theoretic concentration inequalities]]. 

## Arbitrage-free and positive-linearity

A gamble space is called _arbitrage-free_ and positive linear if for all $Z\in\calZ$ with $Z\neq 0$, $Z\ngeq 0$. That is, there exists some  $\omega$ such that $Z(\omega)<0$. This simply means that the bettor can make free money regardless of the outcome. 

A gamble space is positive-linear if for all $Z_1,Z_2\in\calZ$ and positive constants $c_1, c_2$ we have $c_1Z_1 + c_2Z_2\in\calZ$. 

# Almost-sure events 

What does it mean to say that something happens with probability 1 in GTP? 

Here's a result. Suppose $(\Omega,\calZ)$ is arbitrage-free and positive-linear. Let $A\subset\Omega$. If there exists some $Z\in\calZ$ bounded from below such that $Z(\omega)=\infty$ for all $\omega\notin A$, then $\un{\Pr}(A) = \ov{\Pr}(A)=1$. 
This gives a notion of a probability 1 event: If we can gamble on it and make infinite wealth if it does not occur. This is arguably the main machinery used in [[game-theoretic statistics]].
