A p-value is, colloquially, a notion of [[evidence against the null]] in [[hypothesis testing]]. Mathematically, they are typically defined as a random variable $P$ such that, under the null hypothesis $H_0$, obey 
$$
\Pr_{H_0}(P\leq\alpha)\leq \alpha, \quad \forall\alpha\in(0,1).
$$
See [[issues with p-values]] and [[p-hacking]]. Rumour has it that Ronald Fisher invented the p-value for the [[lady tasting tea]] game.
