Inferring properties of an underlying probability distribution (a data-generating process) by means of random samples. 

Can be done via frequentist methods ([[frequentist statistics]]) or Bayesian methods ([[Bayesian statistics]]). Can be done for a fixed-number of samples ([[fixed-time]]) or sequentially ([[safe, anytime-valid inference (SAVI)]]). 

Does it feel stupid to have a page dedicated to such a fundamental concept? Yes, yes it does. But hey, Cosma Shalizi has a note on [statistics](http://bactra.org/notebooks/statistics.html) full stop, and he's much more accomplished than me. Hopefully this note will also be full of hot takes someday.
