Inferring properties of an underlying probability distribution (a data-generating process) by means of random samples. 

Can be done via frequentist methods ([[frequentist statistics]]) or Bayesian methods ([[Bayesian statistics]]). Can be done for a fixed-number of samples ([[fixed-time]]) or sequentially ([[safe, anytime-valid inference (SAVI)]]).
