$$\cF = \bigg\{f: \int (f''(x))^2 dx <\infty\bigg\}.$$
This is "non-parametric" because there's no obvious parameters associated with such a family, besides simply letting $\Theta=\cF$, which is a trivial way to describe it. Contrast this to, e.g., the family of Gaussians, which can be described by two parameters: the mean and the variance. 

Nonparametric statistics is useful when parametric assumptions cannot be met in practice. The drawback is, of course, the we lose
