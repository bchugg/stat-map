Harold Jeffrey's introduced the notion of small-worlds vs large-worlds. Small-worlds have only known unknowns, not unknowns unknowns. Examples of small-worlds include video/board games, poker, and sports. We may not know what will happen, but we know everything that can happen. 

Statistics operates in small-worlds. We place distributional assumptions on the observations and then infer the unknown parameters (but we know those parameters exist!). This is [[statistical inference]]. 

In large worlds, i.e., worlds with unknown unknowns, statistics stops to work. Things can happen that we can't know a priori that may affect our inferences.
