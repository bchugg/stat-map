A Hilbert space is a vector space $H$ equipped with an inner product $\la \cdot,\cdot\ra$, such that every (Cauchy) sequence is convergent (i.e., the limit exists within $H$), where convergence is measured by the distance given by $||f|| = \sqrt{\la f,f\ra}$. 

For instance, the space $$L_2(\cX) = \bigg\{m:\cX\to\Re \;\bigg|\; \int m^2(x)dx<\infty\bigg\},$$
with $\la f,g\ra = \int f(x)g(x)dx$ is a Hilbert space. 

Hilbert spaces are strict subsets of [[HÃ¶lder space]]s.
