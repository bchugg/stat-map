A confidence sequence can be thought of as a sequence of sequentially valid [[confidence intervals]]). Formally, $(C_t)_{t\geq 1}$ is a $(1-\alpha)$-CS for a parameter $\theta$ if 
$$ \Pr(\exists t\geq 1: \theta \notin C_t) \leq \alpha.$$ That is, a CS is a time-uniform confidence interval. It avoids the known problem with confidence intervals that, if they are computed at different times, they risk contradicting themselves (eg an interval computed at time $t_1$ might not overlap with one at time $t_2$. ) 

Equivalent definitions are: 
- $\Pr(\theta^* \in C_\tau)\geq 1-\alpha$ for any stopping time $\tau$ 
- $\Pr(\theta^*\in C_T)\geq 1-\alpha$ for all random times $T$. A random time could be a function of a stopping time, for instance (eg $\tau/2$). 

These are not obviously equivalent definitions. They have to be proved. For instance, the same properties do not hold with expected values. See lemmas 2 and 3 [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03167.pdf).  

They are common tools in [[safe, anytime-valid inference (SAVI)]].
