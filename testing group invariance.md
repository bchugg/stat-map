A particular setup in [[hypothesis testing]] which generalizes [[testing for exchangeability]], testing for sphericity (which can be used to test the Gaussian-error assumption in [[linear regression]]), [[permutation testing]], and sign-flipping tests. 

We have some compact topological group $\calG$, which is a set of invertible transformations $G:\calX\to\calX$ which is closed under composition. We observe some data $X\in \calX$ drawn from distribution. 

We say $X$ is $\calG$-invariant if $X \equald GX$  for all $G\in\calG$. The null and alternative are: 
$$
H_0: X\text{ is group invariant}, \quad H_1: X\text{ is not group invariant}.
$$
