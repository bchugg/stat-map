You're doing some [[statistical inference]] on a Friday night, as one does. You compute some estimate $\wh{\theta}$ of the true parameter $\theta$. But how do you know if it's any good? 

You could look at whether it's consistent, or whether it's unbiased, or whether $\wh{\theta} - \theta$, obeys a [[central limit theorems|CLT]] around the true parameter. But who's to say? The point of statistical decision theory is to provide a formal framework for answering this question.
