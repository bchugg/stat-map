You're doing some [[statistical inference]] on a Friday night, loss a boss. You compute some estimate $\wh{\theta}$ of the true parameter $\theta$. But how do you know if it's any good? 

You could look at whether it's consistent, or whether it's unbiased, or whether $\wh{\theta} - \theta$, obeys a [[central limit theorems|CLT]] around the true parameter. But who's to say?
