Machine learning in which no explicit labels are provided to the algorithm. Common tasks include clustering or dimensionality reduction. Distinct from, but sometimes confused with [[self-supervised learning]]. [[semi-supervised learning|Semi-supervised learning]] combines [[supervised learning]] and unsupervised learning. 

Honestly, if you're here, you should just read the [wiki page on unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). This is mostly a signpost for me to able link to.
