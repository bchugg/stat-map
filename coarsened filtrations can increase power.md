A fascinating phenomenon in some [[sequential hypothesis testing]] problems: Working with less information can make testing easier. That is, constructing [[test-martingale|test martingales]] or [[e-process|e-processes]] in the canonical data filtration $\calF_t = \sigma(X_1,\dots,X_t)$ can lead to powerless tests, but working with the coarsened filtration (by eg transforming the data or looking at a subset of the data) can lead to powerful tests. This is the case in [[testing exchangeability]], for instance. 

Choe and Ramdas study [how to combine e-processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09698) that are developed in different filtrations.
