Anisotropic distributions are those that are not [[isotropic distributions|isotropic]]. 

Informally this means that the variance is not the same in all directionsâ€”the distribution is not rotationally invariant. Perhaps the covariance matrix defines an ellipsoid instead of a sphere, for example. 

Mathematically, the definition is that $P$ is anisotropic if there exists some [[orthogonal matrix]] $Q$ such that 
$$
X \neq QX,
$$
in distribution, where $X\sim P$.  This is simply the negation of the anisotropic condition. Thinking about it intuitively is much easier.
