A class of functions $\calF$ is a Donsker class of the empirical process (see [[empirical process theory]]) given by $\calF$ obeys a [[central limit theorems|CLT]]. (Note that they are CLTs in function classes, i.e., the uniform metric). Donsker classes are similar to [[Glivenko-Cantelli class|GC classes]], but for convergence in distribution instead of convergence in probability or almost sure convergence. Typically the empirical process will converges to a [[Gaussian process]], but in theory it could be any [[infinitely divisible distribution]]. 

If a class has a finite entropy integral (see [[Dudley's entropy bound]]) in terms of [[covering and packing|covering numbers]], then it is Donsker. If it has finite VC dimension (see [[Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory]]) it is often Donsker.
