We are in the setting of [[game-theoretic hypothesis testing]], and now have a composite null. The methods outlined in [[testing by betting—simple vs simple]] and [[testing by betting—simple vs composite]] outline methods to construct [[e-value|e-values]] and [[e-process|e-processes]] which rely heavily on having a point null. 

There are two general methods for handling composite nulls: 
- [[universal inference]] and 
- the [[reverse information projection (RIPr)]] (or, more generally, the [[numeraire e-variable]]).
