The law of likelihood says that any reasonable answer to the question "When is hypothesis A more likely than hypothesis B" (see [[Royall's three questions]]) must be answered in terms of the likelihood ratio. 

In particular, if $P_A. P_B$ are the distributions posited by hypothesis $A$ and $B$ respectively, then we have more evidence for $A$ precisely when the likelihood ratio $\d P_A / \d P_B$ is greater than one, and the magnitude of the likelihood measures the strength of that evidence.
