A perspective on statistics which views the parameters of the statistical model as random. This is in distinction to [[frequentist statistics]] which views them as fixed but unknown. 

 Bayesian methods, both parametric ([[Bayesian parametrics]]) and nonparametric ([[Bayesian nonparametrics]]) put a prior $\pi$ over the model, and then compute a posterior based on given data and the prior. The posterior can then be used in downstream statistical tasks . The prior is why Bayesian statistics is often deemed subjective.
