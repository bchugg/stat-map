> Let $(\Theta,\rho)$ be a [[metric space]].  The entropy number of $\Theta$ with respect to $\rho$ is $$e_n(\Theta) \equiv e_n(\Theta, \rho) := \inf_{\Theta_n}\sup_{\theta \in\Theta} \rho(\theta, \Theta_n),$$
> where the infimum is taken over all subset $\Theta_n$ of $\Theta$ subject to a cardinality constraint (usually $2^{2^n}$ in the case of [[generic chaining]]). 

Entropy numbers show up when proving [[maximal inequalities]] via [[chaining]]-type arguments. [[Dudley's entropy bound]] can be expressed in terms of entropy numbers.
