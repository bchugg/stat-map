[[e-value|E-values]] are easier to combine than [[p-value|p-values]], which is one of their selling points. For instance, by linearity of expectation, given e-variables $E_1,\dots,E_n$, any convex combination $\sum_i \lambda_i E_i$ is an e-value, where $\sum_i\lambda_i = 1$, and $\lambda_i\geq 0$ for all $i$. Note this holds for arbitrarily dependent e-variables.
