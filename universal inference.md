#hypothesis-testing #sequential-statistics 

In [[hypothesis testing]], suppose we are testing a composite null against a composite alternative in a sequential setting ([[sequential statistics]]).  That is, we observe $X_1,X_2,\dots$  [[game-theoretic probability#Gamble spaces, prices, and probabilities]], 

- split data into $D_0$, $D_1$. 
- pick $\wh{\theta}_1\in \Theta_1$ using $D_1$ 
- pick MLE $\wh{\theta}_0$ using $D_0$ 

Let $L_0
