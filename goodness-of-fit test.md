Philosophically, goodness-of-fit tests are interesting, because one usually does not have a specific alternative in mind. They are thus in violation of the [[law of likelihood]] and the [[likelihood principle]]. In general they are contrary to claims that evidence must be measured against a particular alternative (see also [[evidence against the null]]). They are thus somewhat anathema in the [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm]] (though Neyman and Pearson didn't talk in terms of measures of evidence, they talked about decision-making).
