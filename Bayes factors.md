Bayes factors are used in [[hypothesis testing]]. Suppose we are testing a 

$\prod_i f(X_i) / \prod_i g(X_i)$ likelihood of alternative and null. this is a measure of [[evidence against the null]]. 

for composite nulls, typically you mix over priors. but if your prior assigns low prob to the true null or something, you can get an artifically high value.
