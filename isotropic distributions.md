Intuitively, an isotropic distribution is rotationally invariant. That is, it is the same in all directions when viewed from the origin. 

For instance, a normal $N(\mu,\sigma^2I)$ is isotropic, because the variance is the same in all directions. 

Mathematically, we say a distribution $P$ is isotropic if for all [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] $Q$, 
$$
X = QX,
$$
in distribution, where $X\sim P$. The opposite of anisotropy is an [[isotropic distributions|isotropic distribution]].
