A Mercer Kernel on a space $\cX$ is a symmetric function $K:\cX\times\cX\to\Re$ which is symmetric and positive semi-definite. That is, $K(x,y) = K(y,x)$ for all $x$ and $y$ and 
$$\int\int K(x,y)f(x)f(y)dxdy\geq 0,$$
for all $f:\cX\to\Re$. Mercer kernels can be used to construct [[RKHS]] and are therefore a major feature of [[RKHS regression]]. They are also used in [[nonparametric density estimation]]. 

Note that Mercer Kernels are distinct from smoothing kernels, which are used in [[kernel regression]], for instance.
