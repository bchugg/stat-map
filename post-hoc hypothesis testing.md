In standard [[hypothesis testing]], the significance level $\alpha$ must be fixed prior to seeing any data. Choosing $\alpha$ in a data-dependent fashion can lead to [[p-hacking]]; see [[issues with p-values]] for more. 

The goal of post-hoc hypothesis is to solve this problem and allow data to be data-dependent. This is an active area of research. Currently, the most promising solutions use [[e-value|e-values]]: see [[e-values enable post-hoc hypothesis testing]]. This approach involves reformulating error probabilities in terms of risk (as in [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm as decision-theory]]); how you feel about that will depend on you.
