A distribution over the simplex $\Delta_k = \{(x_1,\dots,x_k): \sum_i x_i =1, x_i\geq 1\}$. For this reason, it is often called a "distribution over distributions". 

It has parameters $(\alpha,g_1,\dots,g_k)$ $\sum_i g_i=1$. The pdf is:  
$$p(x_1,\dots,x_n) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{\prod_j \Gamma(\alpha g_j)} \prod_{j} p_j^{\alpha g_j-1}.$$
