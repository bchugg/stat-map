Let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be random variables in $\calX$ and $f:\calX^n \to [0,\infty)$. What can say about the concentration of $f(X^n) \equiv f(X_1,\dots,X_n)$?  


Of course, one has to impose some assumptions on $f$, otherwise we cannot say anything. Common assumptions include: 
- bounded difference assumptions which lead to [[bounded difference inequalities]]. This is an assumption on how much changing one coordinate can affect the function value. 
- The self-bounding property (see [[concentration of self-bounding functions]]). These inequalities typically make use of the [[Efron-Stein inequality]].
