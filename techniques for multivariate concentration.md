Suppose we have a stochastic process $(S_t)$ evolving in some space. What techniques are available for bounding $\norm{S_t}$? If $S_t\in\Re$, then we usually argue about $S_t$ and $- S_t$ and take a union bound to get a bound on $|S_t|$ (see [[light-tailed scalar concentration]] and [[heavy-tailed scalar concentration]]). However, in higher-dimensional spaces (in $\Re^d$, $d\geq 2$, say) a union bound doesn't suffice: there are infinitely many directions one has to worry about. 

Here we explore some techniques to deal with this problem.

# Covering arguments
