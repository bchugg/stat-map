Here we focus on concentration of scalar random variables. See [[multivariate concentration inequalities]] for the more general setting. See also [[matrix inequalities]]. 
We proceed in order of the assumptions needed on the random variables. 



# Markov's inequality 

For a nonnegative random variable $X$ and parameter $a>0$, Markov's inequality states that 
$$\Pr(X\geq a)\leq \E[X]/a.$$
For $X_1,\dots,X_n$ nonnegative with mean $\mu$,  this gives a "concentration" inequality 

There is also a game-theoretic version: [[game-theoretic concentration inequalities#Markov's inequality]]. [[Ville's inequality]] is a time-uniform extension of Markov's inequality for nonnegative supermartingales (or reverse submartingales, as the case may be). 

# Chebyshev's inequality
