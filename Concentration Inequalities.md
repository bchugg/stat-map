This page is a high-level pointer to more specific concentration inequalities in various settings. See: 
- [[light-tailed scalar concentration]]
- [[heavy-tailed scalar concentration]] 
- [[martingale concentration]] 
- [[multivariate concentration]] 
- [[matrix inequalities]]
- [[concentration of functions]] 

For notes related to techniques to achieve concentration, see: 
- [[techniques for multivariate concentration]]
- [[exponential inequalities]], which typically underlie the proofs of many concentration inequalities, and 
- [[basic inequalities]], which contains the building blocks for many concentration results (eg Markov's inequality and the [[Chernoff method]]). 


> [!note] 
> Here we're interested in measure-theoretic concentration, i.e., concentration in measure-theoretic probability spaces. This is what the vast majority of the statistics community means by concentration. But we note that there is also a small literature on [[game-theoretic concentration inequalities]].
