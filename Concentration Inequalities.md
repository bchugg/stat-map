This page is a high-level pointer to more specific concentration inequalities in various settings. See:

- [[light-tailed scalar concentration]]
- [[heavy-tailed scalar concentration]]
- [[martingale concentration]]
- [[multivariate concentration]]
- [[concentration in Banach spaces]]
- [[matrix inequalities]]
- [[concentration of functions]]

For notes related to techniques to achieve concentration, see:

- [[techniques for multivariate concentration]]
- [[exponential inequalities]], which typically underlie the proofs of many concentration inequalities, and
- [[basic inequalities]], which contains the building blocks for many concentration results (eg Markov's inequality and the [[Chernoff method]]).

> [!Note]
> Here we're interested in measure-theoretic concentration, i.e., concentration in measure-theoretic probability spaces. This is what the vast majority of the statistics community means by concentration. But there is also a small literature on [[game-theoretic concentration inequalities]].
