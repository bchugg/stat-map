Here we focus on concentration of scalar random variables. See [[multivariate concentration]] for the more general setting. See also [[matrix inequalities]]. 

This page is a high-level pointer to more specific concentration inequalities in various settings. See: 
- [[light-tailed scalar concentration]]
- [[heavy-tailed scalar concentration]] 
- [[martingale concentration]] 
- [[multivariate concentration]] and [[techniques for multivariate concentration]]

See also [[basic inequalities]] which contains the building blocks for many concentration results. 


> [!note] 
> Here we're interested in measure-theoretic concentration, i.e., concentration in measure-theoretic probability spaces. This is what the vast majority of the statistics community means by concentration. But we note that there is also a small literature on [[game-theoretic concentration inequalities]].
