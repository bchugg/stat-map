[[e-value]] at every stopping time. Strict superset of supermartingales. eg the [[universal inference]] e-process is not a supermartingale. 

Always have the form $N_t = \inf_P M_t^P$ where $M_t^P$ is a $P$-martingale for $P$. 

Game-theoretic interpretation is to partition to null, play a game on each, and take your overall wealth to be the minimum in each game.
