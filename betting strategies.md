In [[game-theoretic statistics]] we have some wealth process $\calK_t = \prod_{i\leq t}S_i$ where the "payoffs" $S_i$ are [[e-value|e-values]] depending on some predictable "bet" $\lambda_i$. The e-values might be of exponential form (see [[exponential inequalities]]) or of the form $1 + \lambda_i G_i$ (eg [[estimating means by betting]]). 

We want $\calK_t$ to increase if some null is not true. If a particular alternative is known, we might consider designing the $S_i$ according to some [[growth rate conditions in sequential testing]]. If not, we need to do something else. Here we gather various strategies.
