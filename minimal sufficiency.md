[[sufficient statistic|Sufficient statistics]] are not unique. This motivates the notion of some sort of minimal sufficient statistic. 

> [!Definition]
> A statistic $T$ is a minimal sufficient statistic if it is a sufficient statistic and it is a function of any other sufficient statistic $S$. That is, for every $S$, there exists some function $g$ such that $g(S(x^n)) = T(x^n)$.
