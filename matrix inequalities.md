Let $<$ denote the matrix (Loewner order). Most the following inequalities apply to more general linear operators. 
## Markov 

For matrix $X$ and PSD $A$, 
$$\Pr(X \not\le A) \leq \Tr(\E[X]A^{-1}).$$
Of course, this reduces to usual  Markov inequality ([[concentration inequalities#Markov's inequality]]).
