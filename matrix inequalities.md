Pointer to matrix inequalities of various kinds. Unlike in the scalar case, there are many things we might mean by "inequality" for matrices. We might mean inequality vis-a-vis the matrix order ([[Loewner order]]), the [[operator norm]], or the maximum eigenvalue. 

See: 
- [[basic matrix inequalities]] for matrix versions of some [[basic inequalities]], such as Markov, Chebyshev, and Chernoff. 
- [[operator norm inequalities]]
