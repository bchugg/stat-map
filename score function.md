Consider the log-likelihood for a parameter $\theta$: $$\ell(\theta) = \log \calL(\theta) = \log \Pr(X^n|\theta).$$The score function is the gradient of $\ell(\theta)$. The score function is used to define the [[Fisher information]]. Note that the score is data-dependent â€”  it is a random quantity. It also comes up when analyzing the asymptotics of the [[MLE]].
