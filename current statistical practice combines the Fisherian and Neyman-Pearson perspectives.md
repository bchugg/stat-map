Current norms around [[hypothesis testing]] combine [[Fisher's paradigm]] and [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm]]. 

Fisher was focused on evidence and introduced the [[p-value]] as a measure of [[evidence against the null]]. Neyman-Pearson, on the other hand, were focused on decision-making.  Current practice is a combination of these two perspectives. We make decisions _and_ report the evidence. For instance, we reject the null _and_ report your p-value.
