The combination of [[post-hoc hypothesis testing]] with [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm as decision-theory]]. In particular, the significance level $\alpha$ is replaced by a loss function. This is not the only way to do post-hoc testing, but it is _a_ way. And it is currently the most well-understood way. 

# Setting 
We consider a set of loss functions $\ell_b(u,v)$ for some index set $b\in\calB$, where $u\in\{0,1\}$ represents whether the null is true (0) or the alternative is true (1), and $v$ is an action in the action space $\calA$ (we may also allow )
