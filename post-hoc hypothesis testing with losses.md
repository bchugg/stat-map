The combination of [[post-hoc hypothesis testing]] with [[Neyman-Pearson paradigm with losses]]. In particular, the significance level $\alpha$ is replaced by a loss function. This is not the only way to do post-hoc testing, but it is _a_ way. And it is currently the most well-understood way. 

First paper along these lines: [Beyond Neyman-Pearson](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00901) by Grunwald.
