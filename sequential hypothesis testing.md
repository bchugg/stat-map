We observe data $X_1,X_2,\dots$ drawn from some distribution $R$, and want to test the hypotheses 
$$
H_0: (X_t) \sim P\in \calP \quad \text{vs}\quad H_1: (X_t)\sim Q\in \calQ,
$$
for some families of distributions $\calP$ and $\calQ$. 

A general approach to sequential hypothesis testing is [[game-theoretic hypothesis testing]].
